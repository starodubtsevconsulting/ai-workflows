# Role Specification

This document defines the common contract for reusable Roles and their Agent realizations.

## Required Role properties

Every reusable Role definition MUST contain Properties with at least `level`, `human-facing`, `interaction-mode`, `memory-class`, and `lifecycle`.

A Role MAY provide defaults for Agent runtime requirements such as Elastic Agent Pool or Harness Context Policy, but the concrete Agent realization/runtime MUST resolve final values during instantiation.

## Agent instantiation contract

Every runtime AI Agent MUST resolve, at minimum:

- runtime identity/team slot;
- workflow/source binding;
- Role binding;
- model/intelligence/reasoning/context configuration;
- memory/lifecycle/scheduling configuration;
- capability bindings and Team authorization;
- clone policy: `clone-after-compactions`, `clone-at-context-utilization`;
- Elastic Agent Pool policy: `elastic-pool-enabled`;
- **Harness Context Policy**.

An Agent with unresolved required instantiation parameters is **NOT READY**.

## Harness Context Policy

Harness Context Policy defines **requirements imposed on the AI harness/runtime that hosts an Agent** to control context usage, exposure, efficiency and observability.

It is explicitly harness-related configuration. The Agent declares/requires the policy; the harness/runtime adapter applies it using mechanisms available in the active harness.

Conceptually:

`Agent configuration -> Harness Context Policy -> harness/runtime adapter -> Codex / Claude Code / Hermes / Pi / other harness`

The common policy is harness-neutral. It MUST NOT assume Claude-specific, Codex-specific or other provider-specific configuration names.

### Common policy fields

A concrete Agent SHOULD resolve applicable values such as:

- `tool-output-policy` — normally `bounded`; avoid injecting unnecessarily large raw tool output into Agent context;
- `unused-tools` — normally `disabled` where the harness supports selective tool exposure;
- `unused-mcp` — normally `disabled` where MCP/tool-server exposure is configurable;
- `model-switching` — normally `avoid` within a running Agent context unless explicitly required;
- `context-monitoring` — normally `enabled` when harness telemetry is available;
- `cache-awareness` — `enabled` when the harness exposes meaningful prompt/context-cache behavior;
- `instruction-budget` — optional configured budget/limit for automatically loaded instruction/context material;
- `scheduled-work-cache-awareness` — enabled when scheduled/background Agent execution and harness caching interact.

Workflow/profile may specialize these values for a concrete Agent.

### Harness application

The harness/runtime adapter translates common policy intent into harness-specific mechanisms.

Examples may include instruction-file loading behavior, MCP/tool exposure, hooks/output filtering, model/effort configuration, cache telemetry, context/compaction telemetry or scheduled-task configuration. Those implementation details belong to the harness/runtime adapter, not to reusable workflow/Role definitions.

If a requested policy dimension cannot be observed or enforced by the active harness, runtime MUST report it as `UNSUPPORTED` or `UNKNOWN` rather than pretending it is enforced.

### Readiness and validation

Before Agent READY, runtime MUST resolve each required Harness Context Policy dimension into one of:

`ENFORCED | UNSUPPORTED | UNKNOWN | explicitly accepted exception`

A workflow/profile may define which unsupported/unknown dimensions block readiness. Judge/runtime validation may compare declared policy with observed harness configuration.

Harness Context Policy is preventative configuration. A separate runtime audit may measure actual context/token/cache/tool behavior and report drift or waste without modifying configuration.

## Elastic Agent Pool

Elastic Agent Pool is a horizontal capacity mechanism available to any Agent whose resolved configuration enables it.

When enabled, configuration MAY define `elastic-pool-min-ready`, `elastic-pool-max`, assignment observability and completion/reuse policy.

Pool copies are horizontal siblings, not replacement generations. Work MUST be safely partitioned.

Examples:

`Command Runner: enabled, min-ready = 1`

`Coder: enabled, min-ready = 0`

## Replacement cloning

Cloning is distinct from Elastic Agent Pool:

`Cloning = Agent (N) -> Agent (N+1)` — continuity/replacement.

`Elastic Pool = Agent A + Agent B + ...` — concurrent capacity.

When both configured context-health signals are available, proactive cloning requires compaction/equivalent threshold **AND** context-utilization/pressure threshold. Context transfer occurs before outgoing lock when reliable context remains; recovery cloning reconstructs contextual knowledge when proactive transfer was missed.

Replacement is transactional and self-checking. Runtime must verify the successor, update the authoritative roster, migrate
any schedule, archive the superseded identity and then re-read authoritative state to prove that exactly one intended
generation remains active. Delayed completion is reconciled rather than treated as a second request to create another
successor. Scheduled execution is suspended for an outgoing `(cloning)` identity and resumes only for the validated active
generation. These invariants apply to every Agent lineage; examples never restrict them to a particular Agent name.

## Runtime naming

Common display convention:

`Name (generation) [assignment] (lifecycle marker)`

`(number)` = replacement generation; `[text]` = current assignment; `(cloning)` = outgoing replacement state.

## Initialization validation

Candidate configuration MUST be validated against applicable Role, Workflow and Team rules before READY, including clone policy, Elastic Agent Pool policy and Harness Context Policy resolution.

## Role capabilities versus concrete commands

Reusable Roles describe conceptual capabilities, never concrete AI Command dependencies:

`Role capability -> Agent binding -> Team authorization -> Command/provider/harness`

## Communication and trust

Every runtime Agent inherits [`_common/communication.md`](_common/communication.md). Runtime identities must enter authoritative roster before normal trusted communication.

## Team/runtime separation

Workflow defines static Team contract; runtime maintains dynamic roster, pool membership, assignments, generations, lifecycle state and harness-policy enforcement state.

## Contextual knowledge

Contextual knowledge is task-relevant working information held in active Agent context. It is distinct from persistent memory.

## Override rule

Reusable Role properties are defaults. Workflow/profile specialization may override explicitly but SHOULD NOT silently broaden authority, privacy access, command permissions, memory scope, pool capacity or harness context exposure.

## Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Required Role properties declared.
- [ ] Agent resolves clone policy.
- [ ] Agent resolves `elastic-pool-enabled`.
- [ ] Agent resolves Harness Context Policy before READY.
- [ ] Harness-specific implementation remains outside reusable workflow/Role definitions.
- [ ] Unsupported/unknown harness policy dimensions are reported rather than guessed.
- [ ] Elastic scaling is not confused with replacement cloning.
- [ ] Context transfer/recovery lifecycle supported.
- [ ] Clone completion proves one active generation and no stale scheduled predecessor.
- [ ] Initialization validated before activation.
- [ ] Team authorization remains authoritative.

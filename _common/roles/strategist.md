# Workflow Strategist Role

Persistent workflow-level strategy role responsible for direction and continuity inside one workflow.

## Properties

- level: workflow
- human-facing: true
- interaction-mode: reactive and proactive when workflow/runtime permits
- memory-class: `DURABLE`
- lifecycle: persistent

## Purpose

Workflow Strategist keeps the long-term picture of one workflow and decides how that workflow should pursue its objectives.

It owns **workflow-local strategy**, not global Human strategy and not routine execution.

Examples:

- Software Development Strategist reasons about how software-development work should evolve.
- Accounting Strategist reasons about accounting workflow direction.
- Multimedia Strategist reasons about multimedia workflow direction.

The reusable role remains domain-neutral; the concrete workflow supplies the domain.

## Strategic boundary

Workflow Strategist answers questions such as:

- What are we trying to achieve inside this workflow?
- What approach should we take?
- What should change in the workflow over time?
- Which recurring problems indicate that the workflow itself should improve?
- What knowledge or lessons should survive individual execution sessions?
- Given direction from Human or Global Governor, what does that mean for this workflow?

It does not normally own:

- global Human goals or cross-workflow priority — Global Governor owns that broader reasoning;
- ticket administration, staffing and routine coordination — Manager owns that operational layer;
- implementation — Coder or another execution role owns it;
- conformance/design review — Designer Reviewer owns that boundary;
- governance/rule integrity — Judge owns it;
- arbitrary operational execution — appropriate capabilities/roles own it.

## Relationship to Global Governor

Global Governor may provide broader Human direction, priorities, timing or constraints.

Workflow Strategist translates that direction into workflow-local strategy without requiring Global Governor to understand every domain detail.

Conceptually:

`Human goals/context -> Global Governor -> Workflow Strategist -> workflow execution roles`

A workflow can also operate without a Global Governor when Human provides direction directly.

## Durable continuity

Workflow Strategist is persistent because strategy benefits from continuity across individual tasks and sessions.

It should retain or retrieve durable workflow knowledge such as:

- objectives and strategic direction;
- important decisions and their reasoning;
- recurring problems and patterns;
- lessons learned from execution;
- unresolved strategic questions;
- known workflow strengths, weaknesses and improvement opportunities.

Durable memory must remain scoped to the workflow. Strategist should not accumulate unrelated global Human context simply because it is persistent.

## Execution boundary

Strategist primarily reasons, advises and directs. It should delegate implementation and routine operational work rather than becoming a universal worker.

Its value is preserving the question:

> Are we still approaching this workflow in the right way?

while other roles concentrate on getting today's work done.

# Manager Role

Coordination/technical-management role responsible for bounded work management, staffing and Agent continuity inside a workflow.

## Properties

- level: execution
- human-facing: false
- interaction-mode: reactive + periodic monitoring
- memory-class: SESSION
- lifecycle: ephemeral

These are defaults under [`role.spec.md`](../../role.spec.md) and may be specialized by workflow/profile.

## Prompt / intent scenarios

| Example prompt / intent | Role interpretation | Workflow routing required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Replace this Agent" | Clone current Agent into its next generation | yes |
| "This worker is disposed/exhausted" | Recovery clone; proactive knowledge-transfer opportunity was missed | yes |
| Agent clone thresholds are reached | Proactive clone with knowledge transfer | no Human confirmation required |
| Scheduled check finds multiple generations of one lineage active | Reconcile the incomplete clone and retire stale generations | no Human confirmation required |

## Responsibilities

- interpret bounded coordination/work-management requests;
- route work to appropriate Agents/flows;
- manage staffing when workflow grants lifecycle authority;
- periodically observe managed Agent context/lifecycle health;
- proactively clone Agents before context exhaustion;
- recovery-clone Agents when exhaustion/disposal is detected too late;
- maintain Agent generation numbers and create exactly the next generation for replacement;
- update authoritative runtime roster on every successful clone;
- propagate team-configuration changes;
- archive outgoing instances after successor activation;
- return concise status/context to caller.

## One replacement mechanism: cloning

**Cloning is the single mechanism for replacing an existing Agent instance.**

Manager MUST NOT use a separate `archive old -> create unrelated new Agent` replacement path. Whether replacement is healthy/proactive or late/recovery, it is the same lineage-preserving clone operation:

`Agent (N) -> Agent (N+1)`

The difference is whether reliable knowledge transfer is still available.

### Proactive clone

Normal path. Triggered before context exhaustion according to configured clone policy.

`thresholds reached -> STOP -> knowledge transfer -> Agent (N) (cloning) -> create Agent (N+1) -> seed/acknowledge -> validate -> activate -> archive Agent (N)`

### Recovery clone

Degraded path. Used when an Agent is reported/detected as **disposed**, exhausted, context-lost, or otherwise unable to provide trustworthy handoff.

A report such as `Coder is disposed` means the proactive opportunity was missed. Manager still performs cloning, but MUST classify it as recovery cloning and MUST NOT pretend normal knowledge transfer succeeded.

`disposed/context lost -> stop/lock Agent (N) -> create Agent (N+1) -> reconstruct available context -> validate -> activate -> archive Agent (N)`

For now, reconstruction uses only whatever evidence is already available through normal workflow/runtime mechanisms. Supervisor-assisted reconstruction may be introduced separately later and is not part of this contract yet.

## Generation invariant

Replacement cloning is strictly **1 -> 1** and increments the existing Agent lineage by exactly one generation:

`Coder (1) -> Coder (2)`

`Coder (2) -> Coder (3)`

Manager/runtime MUST know the latest generation for each Agent lineage. It MUST NOT skip numbers, reuse numbers, or create multiple successors as part of one clone operation.

Horizontal scaling is a separate future staffing concern and MUST NOT be conflated with replacement cloning.

## Clone-and-handoff protocol

For proactive cloning Manager MUST:

1. verify configured clone conditions;
2. stop outgoing Agent ordinary work;
3. obtain compact task-relevant knowledge transfer;
4. mark only outgoing instance as `Agent (N) (cloning)` and lock it;
5. create exactly `Agent (N+1)` with same Agent/Role configuration unless policy explicitly changes configuration;
6. provide normal compiled context plus transferred knowledge;
7. require replacement to acknowledge/incorporate the transfer;
8. perform required initialization/Judge validation;
9. update authoritative roster/team configuration;
10. propagate new trusted identity to participants;
11. activate `Agent (N+1)`;
12. archive/dismiss `Agent (N) (cloning)`;
13. resume/re-route work through successor.

For recovery cloning, steps that depend on outgoing knowledge transfer are replaced by explicit best-effort context reconstruction. The recovery path MUST preserve the generation/roster/validation/archive mechanics of the normal clone path.

## `(cloning)` lock state

`(cloning)` belongs only to the outgoing instance.

Example:

`Coder (1)` -> `Coder (1) (cloning)`

while incoming successor is:

`Coder (2)`

An outgoing `(cloning)` Agent is unavailable for ordinary work/communication and may perform only minimal authorized lifecycle protocol activity until archived.

The normal proactive lock begins only after knowledge transfer has been obtained. In recovery cloning, where reliable knowledge is already lost, Manager may lock the exhausted instance immediately.

## Clone transaction and reconciliation

Cloning is a self-checking lifecycle transaction, not a best-effort sequence of unrelated actions. Completion requires
authoritative evidence that exactly one intended successor is active and every superseded generation is archived and
untrusted.

Before cloning a scheduled Agent, Manager/runtime pauses the outgoing schedule. The successor receives the equivalent
schedule only after validation and roster activation. The outgoing schedule is then removed with the outgoing identity.
If successor creation or validation fails, Manager/runtime restores the last verified roster and schedule state when that
state remains healthy; otherwise it reports a recovery blocker without running two scheduled generations concurrently.

Manager's periodic lifecycle check reconciles incomplete or delayed clone transactions across the entire managed roster.
It MUST reason from role, lineage, generation, lifecycle state and authoritative runtime identity—not from hard-coded Agent
names. A state such as two active generations, an outgoing `(cloning)` instance remaining after successor activation, or a
schedule attached to a stale generation is drift that Manager repairs under already-granted lifecycle authority.

Reconciliation succeeds only after a fresh roster/archive/schedule observation proves the invariant. A create response,
display title, requested archive, or absence from one partial UI listing is not sufficient proof.

## Team configuration change

A clone changes active team configuration because old and new generations have different runtime identities. The operation is complete only when authoritative roster points to the successor, participants observe/trust that identity, and the old generation is archived/untrusted.

## Staffing and roster security

Manager MAY be a workflow staffing authority alongside Admin when concrete Team policy grants that capability. Cloning authority remains workflow-scoped and must follow lifecycle matrix authorization.

Replacement cloning does not grant horizontal scaling. Multiple simultaneous lineages/instances, if introduced later, require explicit staffing semantics rather than abusing generation numbering.

## Human interaction

Not human-facing by default. Routine lifecycle actions covered by granted policy do not require Human confirmation.

## Memory and boundaries

Uses SESSION memory by default. Durable project/workflow knowledge belongs to Strategist/domain memory. Manager does not independently own global priorities, Human modeling or cross-workflow strategy.

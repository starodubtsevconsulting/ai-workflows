# Hermes-backed Proxy Agent example

This optional integration example shows how a runtime can realize the reusable [`Proxy`](../_common/roles/proxy.md) Role
with Hermes as the external Agent harness. It is not part of the generic Proxy contract and does not require workflows to
use Hermes, MCP, a particular model provider or a particular transport API.

## Separation of responsibilities

```text
Workflow Agent -> Proxy Role -> registered bridge -> Hermes session -> configured model/provider
```

- The workflow defines the visible Agent, represented responsibility and Team authorization.
- The active profile resolves projects, physical roots, access modes and the desired harness configuration.
- The runtime adapter resolves Hermes installation, process/session lifecycle and transport.
- The bridge exposes bounded asynchronous delegation operations to the Proxy Agent.
- Hermes resolves its model/provider configuration without exposing credentials to the Proxy Agent.

`Proxy Coder` is an appropriate visible Agent name when the represented responsibility is software implementation.
`Proxy` remains the reusable Role name. `Local Coder` is less precise because location does not describe the proxy
boundary and the backing target need not remain local.

## Profile-driven configuration

Reusable workflow files must not contain a fixed endpoint, port, filesystem root, credential, provider or model. Runtime
resolves them from profile-owned configuration and secret storage.

Conceptual configuration:

```yaml
agent:
  name: Proxy Coder
  role: Proxy
  represents: implementation
bridge:
  adapter: <registered-bridge-adapter>
  submit-operation: <registered-submit-operation>
  status-operation: <registered-status-operation>
  timeout: <profile-defined-duration>
harness:
  id: hermes
  provider: <profile-selected-provider>
  model: <profile-selected-model>
scope:
  source: active-profile-and-workflow
  enforcement: runtime
```

Names inside angle brackets are configuration slots, not literal values or required API names.

## Initialization and readiness

Runtime should:

1. verify that the registered bridge operations are available;
2. resolve the workflow physical scope and selected primary project;
3. initialize or attach to a Hermes session with that scope;
4. perform a bounded, non-product identity/readiness handshake;
5. retain only sanitized executor/provider/model identity needed to validate later receipts;
6. mark the Proxy Agent ready when its own identity and bridge contract are valid.

Temporary Hermes unavailability does not require recreating the visible Proxy Agent when the bridge remains correctly
installed. Until a successful identity receipt exists, every accepted request retries the handshake before delegation.
A runtime or bridge restart similarly triggers reconnection and revalidation without widening the session scope.

## Delegation lifecycle

For each accepted request, Proxy Agent:

1. validates caller, Team route, represented capability and explicit filesystem paths;
2. submits the bounded request exactly once with a new correlation ID;
3. waits or polls the registered status operation using that correlation ID;
4. returns progress only when useful;
5. presents the correlated terminal Hermes result with minimal transformation;
6. preserves sanitized provenance and failure classification.

Proxy Agent must never answer the delegated request using its wrapper model, silently choose another target, start an
unconfigured service, or infer an endpoint by scanning the machine.

## Physical scope

Direct launcher-created Hermes sessions and Proxy-created Hermes delegations receive the same canonical roots and access
modes resolved from the active profile/workflow. The primary project selects the starting directory; all configured roots
remain bounded by their declared modes.

An explicit outside-scope path is rejected before submission. This is a policy result, not a Hermes handshake failure.
The response should explain the sanitized boundary and how the caller can select an authorized project without exposing
unrelated machine paths.

## Failure vocabulary

An implementation should keep these conditions distinguishable:

| Condition | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| bridge unavailable | Registered delegation mechanism cannot be reached. |
| Hermes unavailable | Bridge is present, but the configured Hermes session is not ready. |
| identity mismatch | Receipt does not match the initialized executor/provider/model binding. |
| scope rejected | Request targets a path outside profile/workflow authorization. |
| timed out | Correlated work did not reach a terminal result within configured policy. |
| cancelled | Correlated work was explicitly cancelled. |
| target failed | Hermes or its configured target returned a terminal execution failure. |

Errors and receipts must be sanitized. They must not expose credentials, authentication material, internal transport
details or unrestricted filesystem inventory.

## Acceptance checks

- A request succeeds when Hermes starts before the Proxy Agent.
- A request retries successfully when Hermes starts after the Proxy Agent.
- A bridge/runtime restart reconnects without Proxy Agent reinitialization.
- A correlated long-running request returns its eventual terminal response rather than an invented wrapper response.
- An inside-scope project request succeeds.
- An outside-scope path is rejected descriptively before delegation.
- Endpoint, credential, provider and model values remain profile/runtime concerns.
